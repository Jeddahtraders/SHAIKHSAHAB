        <p>A solid and technically sound left-hand opener, Shan Masood made it to the international side after impressing consistently at junior-level cricket. With Pakistan struggling to put together a solid opening combination, Masood was the option they turned to in the Test series against South Africa in the UAE.
            Masood caught the eye of Pakistan's talent-spotters quite early, being selected as a 13-year-old for the U-15 Asia Cup in 2002 after impressing Aaqib

     <h3>Iftikhar Ahmed</h3>
     <p>Iftikhar Ahmed born in Peshawar, Pakistan is a top-order batsman and a more than handy offie. He has represented Pakistan in every format and was a part of the squad which drew the Test series 2-2 against England in England in 2016. However, it was rather an forgettable debut in a memorable game for Pakistan as they levelled the series in the final Test at Oval.

        Prior to that he debuted in the T20i's and ODI's in 2016 and 2015 respectively. Again, failures in those handful of games meant that he was sidelined. But his strong performances at the domestic level have always kept him in the reckoning of a national call-up.
        
        He was a part of the Karachi Kings in the first edition of the PSL. But they released him and now is a part of Peshawar Zalmi. At the age of 27, his dreams if playing for Pakistan are still viable.
