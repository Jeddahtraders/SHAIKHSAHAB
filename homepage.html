<H3>HISTORY AND PRESENT</H3> </center>
<p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is a sports governing body for cri
cket in Pakistan responsible for controlling and organising all tours a
nd matches undertaken by the Pakistan national cricket team. A member o\
f the International Cricket Council since 1952, it represents the count
ry's men's and women's national teams in international cricket tourname
nts played under the ICC.[5]</p>
<p>Following the establishment of Pakistan as an independent dominion o\
f the British Empire in 1947, professional and amateur cricket commence
d in the same year, seeing as local infrastructure had already been esta
blished when the country was part of the British Raj. Cricket matches we
re arranged informally until 1948, when a Board of Control was formally 
instituted. Pakistan was admitted to the Imperial Cricket Conference 
urrently known as International Cricket Council) in July 1952, and has 
since been a full member, playing Test cricket. The team's first Test 
series took place in India between October and December 1952.[6]</p>
<CENTEr><H3>Inaugural Board of Control</H3></CENTEr>
<P>The Pakistan Cricket Board was inaugurated on 1 May 1949 as the
 Board of Control for Cricket in Pakistan (BCCP).[7] The first meeting
 , held in the committee rooms of Lahore Gymkhana, saw HE Iftikhar Hussa
 in Khan Mamdot, the Nawab of Mamdot, made president and chairman, wit
 h Justice A. R. Cornelius as one of three vice-presidents. The following
  year, Cornelius became chairman of the working committee, until he rel
  inquished his connection with the board in early 1953.[8]
The working chairman was always one of the three vice-presidents. In April
 1957, Ayub Khan imposed three more new vice-presidents (himself being one 
 of them). Then between December 1958 and September 1969 the post of vice-p
 resident disappeared.</P>
<center><h3>Committees</h3></center>
<p>The response to turmoil within the board has on four occasions been t
o suspend the rules and appoint an ad hoc committee. The first ad hoc co
mmittee was appointed in September 1960 and did not disband until May 19
63 having created a new constitution. The President of Pakistan would no
w nominate the board president who would in turn nominate the other mem
bers of the executive committee to sit for a period of three years. Repr
esentatives of the four provincial cricket associations and Government d
epartments formed the executive committee.
The BCCP was re-organised in the 1970s and was headed by former cricketer
s, professional administrators and trustees, who were often businessmen
.[9] In November 1976 players' demands for increased salaries reached a
 crisis and the Pakistan Sports Board took over running the B.C.C.P.'s a
 ffairs. Long-serving president, the formidable Kardar, was in the thick 
 of the dispute. The revolt against Kardar forced him to resign in May 1
 977 and led to a new Ad Hoc Committee replacing the Board Council in 197
 8 running Pakistan cricket and again changing the constitution. Provincial
  Cricket Associations were eliminated and divisional and city CAs became
members, giving most of the influence to the city Cricket Association of 
Lahore and Karachi.
The Board now governed a network of teams sponsored by corporations and ba
nks, city associations and clubs.[9] There is no province-based official te
am type organisation of domestic cricket in Pakistan and Lahore and Karachi
 cities are the two top tiers of all cricket, including reservoirs of fresh 
 talent.[10][9]
Pakistan cricket was involved by dissension and controversies over the natio
nal team's poor performance during the tour of India and a public uproar forc
ed the end of the Ad Hoc Committee.[9] The chairman and team captain Asif Iqb
al had to step down.[11] Air Marshal Nur Khan now became chairman and he saw 
the banks and other organisations increase their participation on the Board 
Council in the face of protests from the zonal organisations.
 A third ad hoc committee under Javed Burki took charge of BCCP affairs in
 January 1994 and made a new constitution including giving a new name, the 
 Pakistan Cricket Board (P.C.B.) It introduced a chairman and chief executive.
 After taking heavy criticism on the grounds of corruption and match fixing,
 the Board was taken over by a fourth Ad Hoc Committee formed on 17 July 1999 
 which remains in place despite undertakings from Musharraf to bring it to an
 end. The Pakistan Cricket Board re-emerged by taking the initiative to sponso
 r the hugely successful 2004 tour of Pakistan by their rivals India. The Pak
 istan Cricket Board has competed and has associated itself with the Twenty20 
 cricket form and has also proven popular and hopes to similarly revive popular
  interest in domestic games. However, Pakistan's early exit from the 2007 World
   Cup cast a shadow and later Dr. Nasim Ashraf's resigned at the end of 2008.
Ejaz Butt was named the PCB Chairman in October 2008. Zaka Ashraf took over f
rom Butt in October 2011.[12][13]
On 28 May 2013, Zaka Ashraf was suspended as PCB Chairman by Islamabad High Co
urt due to a dubious election. The newly sworn in Government of Nawaz Sharif name
d Najam Sethi as acting PCB Chairman.[14] On 15 October 2013, the governing counc
il of the Pakistan Cricket Board was dissolved by the Prime Minister of Pakistan,
 Nawaz Sharif, and an interim five man management committee was named consisting o
 f acting chairman Najam Sethiâ€š Shahryar Khan, two former players (Zaheer Abbas an
 d Haroon Rasheed, and former team manager Naveed Cheema.[15]
 On 15 January 2014, Zaka Ashraf was reinstated as PCB Chairman. The PML-N Governm
 ent was unhappy with the reinstatement (since Ashraf was a PPP appointee), and t
 his led to Ashraf's sacking. In February, PCB Governing Board was dissolved
  and an eight-member management committee (comprising Shakil Sheikh, Shaharyar
   Khan, Zaheer Abbas, Iqbal Qasim, Naveed Akram Cheema, Yusaf Naseem Khokar and Fa
   ridullah Khan, the secretary IPC). Najam Sethi was elected as chairman by
    the management committee.[16]</p>
 <center><h3>Domestic cricket</h3></center>
 <p>The structure of domestic cricket in Pakistan at the highest level has changed 
many times since 1947 with the latest restructure being enforced in 2019.[17] Previ
ously domestic cricket operated with departmental, city and regional teams - a set \
up encouraged by Abdul Hafeez Kardar.[18] Since 1947, the domestic first class cricket
system has varied considerably per year with teams ranging from 7 to 26 and tournament
matches operating under different formats (often changes occurred every year). With t\
he advent of domestic List A and T20 forms of cricket in the 1970s and 2000s, there has
been no consistent set up (as has been noted for first class cricket in Pakistan).
Historically, school and club cricket has also suffered due to inconsistencies in 
top tier domestic cricket. The consistent changes in the domestic structure and the gradual
 introduction of departmental teams was encouraged as it provided permanent jobs to players. 
 Matches were rarely televised due to lack of quality cricket and lack of interest in 
 departmental cricket. This inconsistent system was widely criticised on the basis of low
 quality cricket and reduced competition.
In 2019, six regional teams were created on provincial lines. The teams would compete in 
the principal competitions in all three formats of the game: the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy (First Class)
, Pakistan Cup (List A) and National T20 Cup (Domestic T20). The PCB's rationale in reducing the number 
of teams in domestic cricket was to concentrate talent in order to increase competition and improve the 
quality of cricket. The new structure also consisted of corresponding second XI, under-19, under-16 and 
under-13 competitions, and live television coverage of top level matches.[19] The restructuring also
 reorganised district level cricket into a three tier bottom-up system, with 90 city cricket associat
 ions supervising school and club cricket at grassroots level, and inter-city tournaments providing a 
 stepping-stone to the six elite regional teams.[20][21]
The six regional teams (operated by respective six cricket associations) ensure that the affairs of the
 associations at city level are regulated. They frame policies that will develop cricket at the grassroots
 , manage club cricket in collaboration with the 90 city associations and also oversee intra-city competitions
 . The teams are responsible for revenue generation through sponsorship, marketing and strategic collaborations 
 with business conglomerates. Each of the six regional teams have a chief executive officer and a management co
 mmittee that has been tasked with supervising all cricketing activities. These changes have been made by the 
 PCB in order to decentralise the administrative body so that it can limit itself to a supervisory role by deleg
 ating responsibilities related to the development of the sport to the provincial associations.[20] This tiered 
 structure has been enshrined in the PCB constitution.[22]</p>
